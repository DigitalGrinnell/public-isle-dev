# Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)

ISLE is a community developed open-source project that bundles the [Islandora](https://islandora.ca) stack into a set of [Docker](https://docker.com) images that are easy to install and update. ISLE allows for persistent customizations and provides a fully functioning Islandora platform for production, staging, and development digital repositories.

This documentation provides clear instructions on how to do the following types of installations and updates:

* [Demo ISLE Installation](install/host-hardware-requirements.md): Quickly learn how to use Docker to create a new Islandora platform on your personal computer. Use this to "kick the tires" on ISLE.

* [ISLE Installation](install/host-hardware-requirements.md):
Follow these successive steps to create a complete workflow by installing ISLE on a Local personal computer, and then on Staging and Production environments. This workflow creates a production ready Islandora site and a workflow that supports  updates, customization, and development. Additionally, you may choose to build this workflow for a New Islandora site or use this to Migrate your existing Islandora 7.x site.

* [Update ISLE](update/update.md): Update your version of ISLE to the latest release and receive improvements and security updates.
